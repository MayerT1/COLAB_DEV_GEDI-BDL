However, since 2020 ferns are only scheduled for sampling every 5 years in Tower plots, and thus ferns are no longer measured in four out of five years in annually sampled Tower plots. For annually sampled Tower plots where ferns are the only 'other' type of growth form, the reported totalSampledAreaOther value suggested no fern biomass for four out of five years, when in fact ferns simply were not sampled for those years. Moreover, in annually sampled Tower plots where ferns coexist with some of the ‘other’ growth forms (e.g., palms in D03, xerophyllum in D16, tree ferns in D20), we reported a totalSampledAreaOther value for the ‘other’ growth forms that were measured annually, and for four out of five years we created the impression that zero fern biomass was legitimately measured, even though ferns were not scheduled for sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>Introduced new ‘nestedSubplotAreaFerns’ and ‘totalSampledAreaFerns’ fields in the vst_perplotperyear table to account for fern measurement separately from remaining ‘other’ growth forms.

For example, ‘21_400’ refers to a subplot with point 21 in the southwest corner and having 400 m2 area (20 m x 20 m). Similarly, ‘31_1_1’ refers to a subplot with point 31 in the southwest corner, having 1 m2 area, and located in corner 1 of the 100 m2 subplot with point 31 in the southwest corner.

For the affected date range, field staff working at the D13 MOAB site were provided guidance to assess cover from and measure small, multi-stem shrub individuals only if ≥ 50% of stems for a given individual had basal diameter ≥ 1 cm. This guidance was inconsistent with the Vegetation Structure protocol (NEON.DOC.000987), which instructs to measure small, multi-stem shrub individuals if at least one stem has basal diameter ≥ 1 cm. Because guidance not consistent with the protocol was followed, plots sampled at MOAB in the affected date range included approximately 10 fewer small, multi-stem shrubs per plot than if the Vegetation Structure protocol guidance were followed. Measuring fewer individuals per plot means that per plot biomass and volume estimates for the ‘small shrub’ growth form are lower for 2023 than for other years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Qualification criteria for cover assessment and measurement of small, multi-stem shrub individuals (i.e., growth form = ‘small shrub’) were reverted to those documented in the Vegetation Structure protocol (NEON.DOC.000987).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </span></td></tr>\n",

When Tower plots are sampled for Vegetation Structure, a ‘towerSubset’ of n=5 plots are sampled annually, and the full complement of plots are sampled every 5 years. Prior to 2020, the five annually sampled towerSubset plots were determined using only spatial balance criteria, and at some sites, this resulted in over- or under-representation of NLCD vegetation classes relative to the full complement of Tower plots. From 2020 onward, spatial balance and NLCD representation criteria were used to select the annually sampled towerSubset plots, and a Plot Prioritization list was distributed to communicate the change. However, implementation of the change was not immediate at some sites, and the actual annual towerSubset sampled at affected sites differed from the Plot Prioritization list for at least one sampling year in the affected date range. The deviation from the Plot Prioritization list means that biomass and productivity estimates derived from the towerSubset plots at affected sites may not be as representative as possible of the full complement of Tower plots. For the PUUM site the issue was slightly different; at PUUM, deviations in spatial balance occurred to better coordinate Vegetation Structure sampling in the annual Tower subset with soil sampling, and these deviations were not documented in the approved Plot Prioritization list.                                                                         </td><td>For the site-specific resolution dates identified below, annual sampling for Vegetation Structure in the towerSubset occurs in plots identified by spatial balance and NLCD vegetation type criteria, and annually sampled plots are consistent with the Plot Prioritization list. At the D20 PUUM site, all plots have the same NLCD type (i.e., evergreen forest), and a slight deviation from the spatially-balanced Plot Prioritization list was approved for Vegetation Structure sampling to enable spatial coordination with soil sampling (DP1.10086.001), which is constrained by soil depth in some plots due to relatively recent lava flow. \n",

That is, for a jagged break, the reported data could correspond to vertical distance between the lowest and highest parts of the break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>From 2024 onward, reported break height data conform to protocol expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>\n",

              "\t<tr><td>Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from in-situ measurements of live and standing dead woody individuals, shrub groups, and non-herbaceous perennial plants from all terrestrial NEON sites with qualifying woody vegetation. The exact measurements collected per individual depend on growth form, and these measurements are focused on enabling biomass and productivity estimation, estimation of shrub volume and biomass, and calibration / validation of multiple NEON airborne remote-sensing data products. In general, comparatively large individuals that are visible to remote-sensing instruments are mapped, tagged, and measured, and other smaller and understory individuals are tagged and measured but not mapped. Structure and mapping data are reported per individual per plot. Smaller individuals may be subsampled using nested subplots in order to standardize the per plot sampling effort; total sampled area data reported in the vst_perplotperyear table are required to convert measurements made using nested subplots to the plot scale.

              "\t<tr><td>Brief Design Description: Vegetation Structure data are collected from Distributed and Tower plots. Each Distributed plot is sampled in a given bout if at least one tree with Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm or one tree palm is present. If trees with DBH ≥ 10 cm and tree palms are absent, all smaller qualifying vegetation is considered: both woody and non-herbaceous perennial vegetation are sampled if all qualifying individuals of both types comprise ≥ 10% aerial cover of the plot. For example, a Distributed plot with 10% aerial cover comprising a mix of small shrubs and yucca would be sampled for yucca even if total yucca cover is &lt; 10% aerial cover. Ferns, Xerophyllum, and Yucca have additional sampling criteria within Distributed plots: These three growth forms are not measured when the NLCD vegetation type of the plot is Deciduous Forest, Evergreen Forest, or Mixed Forest. In addition, when Distributed plot NLCD vegetation type is not forest, ferns are only sampled when aerial cover is ≥ 50% within the plot. Tower plots are sampled if at least one tree with DBH ≥ 10 cm or one tree palm is present in ≥ 10% of Tower plots, or if smaller qualifying individuals comprise ≥ 10% of aerial cover averaged across all Tower plots. Within both Distributed and Tower plots, all individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm are mapped and measured throughout the plot sampling area. Individuals with DBH &lt; 10 cm are mapped if a) individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm are absent from the plot, and b) they are visible to airborne remote-sensing instruments. If stem density thresholds are met, individuals with DBH &lt; 10 cm and non-herbaceous perennial vegetation, such as ferns and saw palmetto, may be measured within nested subplots in order to standardize the sampling effort across plots.</td></tr>\n",
              "\t<tr><td>At all sites at which qualifying woody vegetation is present, Distributed plots are sampled every 5 years. At most sites with qualifying woody vegetation, a spatially-balanced subset of n=5 tower plots are sampled annually, and the full complement of Tower plots is sampled every 5 years. At slow-growth-increment sites (RMNP, YELL, NIWO, WREF, SJER, SOAP, TEAK, BONA, DEJU, HEAL), dendrometer bands are measured annually on a subset of individuals within Tower plots. At desert sites with sensitive vegetation and soils (i.e., MOAB, JORN, SRER, ONAQ), there is no annual Tower plot measurement and the full complement of Tower plots is measured every 5 years only. Ferns are only sampled in Tower plots when all Tower plots are sampled every 5 years; that is, ferns are not measured annually in the n=5 Tower plot subset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

              "\t<tr><td>At sites with seasonal senescence, the onset of sampling in a given year is triggered by senescence of canopy or understory individuals. Sampling must be completed before growth begins the following season and within 4 months of sampling onset. At sites with no distinct season, sampling begins within ± 2 weeks of the same date, and must be completed within 60 days of sampling onset.

For the `vst_mappingandtagging` table, queries ignore the user-specified date range and return all records for each user-selected site regardless of the user-specified date, due to the fact that individuals may be tagged and mapped in a year prior to the user-selected sampling event. Data are provided in monthly download files; queries including any part of a month will return data from the entire month. In the `vst_perplotperyear` table, there should be one record per plotID per eventID, and data in this table describe the presence/absence and sampling area of woody and non-woody growth forms. The `vst_mappingandtagging` table contains at least one record per individualID, and provides data that are invariant through time, including tagID, taxonID, and mapped location (if applicable). Duplicates in `vst_mappingandtagging` may exist at the individualID level if errors have been corrected after ingest of the original record; in this instance, users are advised to use the most recent record for a given individualID. The `vst_apparentindividual` table contains one record per individualID per eventID, and includes growth form, structure and plant status data that may be linked to `vst_mappingandtagging` records via the individualID; records may also be linked to `vst_perplotperyear` via the plotID and eventID fields in order to generate plot-level estimates of biomass and productivity. The `vst_non-woody` table contains one record per individualID per eventID, and contains growth form, structure and status data that may be linked to `vst_perplotperyear` data via the plotID and eventID fields. The `vst_shrubgroup` table contains a minimum of one record per groupID per plotID per eventID; multiple records with the same groupID may exist if a given shrub group comprises more than one taxonID. Data provided in the `vst_shrubgroup` table allow calculation of live and dead volume per taxonID within each shrub group, and records may be linked with the `vst_perplotperyear` table via the plotID and eventID fields.</td></tr>\n",

Taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been 'fuzzed'; see data package readme files for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",

From the inception of these two data products, the ‘vst_perplotperyear’ table was common to both; moreover, recent evolution of the ‘Non-herbaceous’ data product to include mapping and tagging of large-stature cacti, palms, and tree ferns meant that the ‘vst_mappingandtagging’ table was also shared across the two products. Splitting out the ‘vst_non-woody’ table into a separate product therefore created unnecessary complexity for data end-users who wished to understand the totality of vegetation structure measurements collected at a site where non-herbaceous perennial vegetation was present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The ‘Woody plant vegetation structure’ (DP1.10098.001) and ‘Non-herbaceous perennial vegetation structure’ (DP1.10045.001) data products were bundled into the new ‘Vegetation structure’ data product (DP1.10098.001).

The new method selects plots for annual sampling such that plots are proportionally representative of the NLCD vegetation classes present in each site's Tower airshed, and the method maximizes collocation of Vegetation Structure measurements with annual TOS soil and plant diversity sampling. In Domain 05, the plots identified for annual sampling according to the new method are: \n\n`STEI_047`, `STEI_053`, `STEI_056`, `STEI_059`, `STEI_060`\n`TREE_041`, `TREE_046`, `TREE_049`, `TREE_054`, `TREE_056`\n`UNDE_037`, `UNDE_038`, `UNDE_043`, `UNDE_044`, `UNDE_045` \n\nFor the following sites and years, plots were sampled according to the older spatial balance algorithm that does not account for NLCD Vegetation Class, and does not maximize collocation with soil and plant diversity data products: \n\n2020 STEI subset measured: `STEI_046`, `STEI_047`, `STEI_048`, `STEI_049`, `STEI_050`\n2021 STEI subset measured: `STEI_046`, `STEI_047`, `STEI_053`, `STEI_056`, `STEI_059`, `STEI_060`\n2020 TREE subset measured: `TREE_039`, `TREE_040`, `TREE_041`, `TREE_042`, `TREE_043`\n2020 UNDE subset measured: `UNDE_037`, `UNDE_038`, `UNDE_043`, `UNDE_044`, `UNDE_065`\n2021 UNDE subset measured: `UNDE_037`, `UNDE_038`, `UNDE_043`, `UNDE_044`, `UNDE_045`, `UNDE_065` | From 2022 onward, Tower plots selected for annual sampling at STEI, TREE, and UNDE are:\n\n`STEI_047`, `STEI_053`, `STEI_056`, `STEI_059`, `STEI_060`\n`TREE_041`, `TREE_046`, `TREE_049`, `TREE_054`, `TREE_056`\n`UNDE_037`, `UNDE_038`, `UNDE_043`, `UNDE_044`, `UNDE_045`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 68808 | NA | 2022-09-15T00:00:00Z | 2022-10-31T00:00:00Z | 2022-06-12T00:00:00Z | 2022-10-31T00:00:00Z | YELL                                                                                                                                                                   | Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff.

However, since 2020 ferns are only scheduled for sampling every 5 years in Tower plots, and thus ferns are no longer measured in four out of five years in annually sampled Tower plots. For annually sampled Tower plots where ferns are the only 'other' type of growth form, the reported totalSampledAreaOther value suggested no fern biomass for four out of five years, when in fact ferns simply were not sampled for those years. Moreover, in annually sampled Tower plots where ferns coexist with some of the ‘other’ growth forms (e.g., palms in D03, xerophyllum in D16, tree ferns in D20), we reported a totalSampledAreaOther value for the ‘other’ growth forms that were measured annually, and for four out of five years we created the impression that zero fern biomass was legitimately measured, even though ferns were not scheduled for sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Introduced new ‘nestedSubplotAreaFerns’ and ‘totalSampledAreaFerns’ fields in the vst_perplotperyear table to account for fern measurement separately from remaining ‘other’ growth forms. The ‘totalSampledAreaFerns’ field is now NULL when ferns are present but not sampled due to the scheduled bout type. In addition, the totalSampledAreaOther field now accurately reflects the sampling effort for the remaining ‘other’ growth forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| 77905 | NA | 2023-03-01T00:00:00Z | 2023-03-01T00:00:00Z | 2015-01-01T00:00:00Z | 2023-03-01T00:00:00Z | DSNY, JERC, OSBS                                                                                                                                                       | A single ‘palm’ growth form was applied to all palm trees, regardless of size, and to shrub-type palms.

The format consists of the identity of the plot point in the southwest corner of the subplot, the scale or size of the subplot, and, for those subplots smaller than 100 m2, the corner of the 100 m2 subplot in which the smaller subplot is located. For example, ‘21_400’ refers to a subplot with point 21 in the southwest corner and having 400 m2 area (20 m x 20 m).

For the affected date range, field staff working at the D13 MOAB site were provided guidance to assess cover from and measure small, multi-stem shrub individuals only if ≥ 50% of stems for a given individual had basal diameter ≥ 1 cm. This guidance was inconsistent with the Vegetation Structure protocol (NEON.DOC.000987), which instructs to measure small, multi-stem shrub individuals if at least one stem has basal diameter ≥ 1 cm. Because guidance not consistent with the protocol was followed, plots sampled at MOAB in the affected date range included approximately 10 fewer small, multi-stem shrubs per plot than if the Vegetation Structure protocol guidance were followed. Measuring fewer individuals per plot means that per plot biomass and volume estimates for the ‘small shrub’ growth form are lower for 2023 than for other years.

‘towerSubset’. When Tower plots are sampled for Vegetation Structure, a ‘towerSubset’ of n=5 plots are sampled annually, and the full complement of plots are sampled every 5 years. Prior to 2020, the five annually sampled towerSubset plots were determined using only spatial balance criteria, and at some sites, this resulted in over- or under-representation of NLCD vegetation classes relative to the full complement of Tower plots. From 2020 onward, spatial balance and NLCD representation criteria were used to select the annually sampled towerSubset plots, and a Plot Prioritization list was distributed to communicate the change. However, implementation of the change was not immediate at some sites, and the actual annual towerSubset sampled at affected sites differed from the Plot Prioritization list for at least one sampling year in the affected date range. The deviation from the Plot Prioritization list means that biomass and productivity estimates derived from the towerSubset plots at affected sites may not be as representative as possible of the full complement of Tower plots. For the PUUM site the issue was slightly different; at PUUM, deviations in spatial balance occurred to better coordinate Vegetation Structure sampling in the annual Tower subset with soil sampling, and these deviations were not documented in the approved Plot Prioritization list.                                                                          | For the site-specific resolution dates identified below, annual sampling for Vegetation Structure in the towerSubset occurs in plots identified by spatial balance and NLCD vegetation type criteria, and annually sampled plots are consistent with the Plot Prioritization list. At the D20 PUUM site, all plots have the same NLCD type (i.e., evergreen forest), and a slight deviation from the spatially-balanced Plot Prioritization list was approved for Vegetation Structure sampling to enable spatial coordination with soil sampling (DP1.10086.001), which is constrained by soil depth in some plots due to relatively recent lava flow. \n\nSite-specific resolution dates: \nD05 STEI and UNDE – deviations in 2020 and 2021, resolved thereafter. \nD05 TREE – deviations in 2020, resolved thereafter. \nD06 KONZ – deviations in 2020 and more plots sampled than expected in 2021; resolved thereafter. \nD07 GRSM and ORNL – deviations in 2020, resolved thereafter. \nD07 MLBS – deviations in 2020 and 2021, resolved thereafter. \nD08 DELA and LENO – deviations from 2020-2022, resolved thereafter. \nD11 CLBJ – deviations in 2020, resolved thereafter. \nD19 BONA and DEJU – deviations in 2020, resolved thereafter. \nD20 PUUM – inconsistent annual Tower subset sampled from 2020-2023; resolved thereafter.            |\n| 92604 | NA | 2024-09-05T00:00:00Z | 2024-08-27T00:00:00Z | 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z | 2024-08-14T00:00:00Z | JERC, OSBS, GUAN, CPER, CLBJ, JORN, SRER                                                                                                                               | Yucca sampling: The protocol lacked a height threshold for sampling the yucca growth form, resulting in sampling many small-stature yucca that likely contribute relatively little to plot-level biomass. The protocol also lacked guidance for measuring ‘height’ for yucca with flower stalks. As such, all past 'height' measurements for yucca are unclear with respect to whether the individual was flowering and whether the flower stalk may have been included in the height.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | A 30 cm height threshold for sampling yucca was introduced, identical to the threshold used for sampling ferns.

That is, for a jagged break, the reported data could correspond to vertical distance between the lowest and highest parts of the break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | From 2024 onward, reported break height data conform to protocol expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 99904 | NA | 2025-02-17T00:00:00Z | 2025-02-17T00:00:00Z | 2015-07-01T00:00:00Z | 2024-11-21T00:00:00Z | RMNP, NIWO, ABBY, WREF                                                                                                                                                 | Crown diameter error: For leaning individuals, the main bole(s) may extend beyond the average extent of the crown.

This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from in-situ measurements of live and standing dead woody individuals, shrub groups, and non-herbaceous perennial plants from all terrestrial NEON sites with qualifying woody vegetation. The exact measurements collected per individual depend on growth form, and these measurements are focused on enabling biomass and productivity estimation, estimation of shrub volume and biomass, and calibration / validation of multiple NEON airborne remote-sensing data products. In general, comparatively large individuals that are visible to remote-sensing instruments are mapped, tagged, and measured, and other smaller and understory individuals are tagged and measured but not mapped. Structure and mapping data are reported per individual per plot. Smaller individuals may be subsampled using nested subplots in order to standardize the per plot sampling effort; total sampled area data reported in the vst_perplotperyear table are required to convert measurements made using nested subplots to the plot scale.

Distributed and Tower plots. Each Distributed plot is sampled in a given bout if at least one tree with Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm or one tree palm is present. If trees with DBH ≥ 10 cm and tree palms are absent, all smaller qualifying vegetation is considered: both woody and non-herbaceous perennial vegetation are sampled if all qualifying individuals of both types comprise ≥ 10% aerial cover of the plot. For example, a Distributed plot with 10% aerial cover comprising a mix of small shrubs and yucca would be sampled for yucca even if total yucca cover is &lt; 10% aerial cover. Ferns, Xerophyllum, and Yucca have additional sampling criteria within Distributed plots: These three growth forms are not measured when the NLCD vegetation type of the plot is Deciduous Forest, Evergreen Forest, or Mixed Forest. In addition, when Distributed plot NLCD vegetation type is not forest, ferns are only sampled when aerial cover is ≥ 50% within the plot. Tower plots are sampled if at least one tree with DBH ≥ 10 cm or one tree palm is present in ≥ 10% of Tower plots, or if smaller qualifying individuals comprise ≥ 10% of aerial cover averaged across all Tower plots. Within both Distributed and Tower plots, all individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm are mapped and measured throughout the plot sampling area. Individuals with DBH &lt; 10 cm are mapped if a) individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm are absent from the plot, and b) they are visible to airborne remote-sensing instruments. If stem density thresholds are met, individuals with DBH &lt; 10 cm and non-herbaceous perennial vegetation, such as ferns and saw palmetto, may be measured within nested subplots in order to standardize the sampling effort across plots. |\n| At all sites at which qualifying woody vegetation is present, Distributed plots are sampled every 5 years. At most sites with qualifying woody vegetation, a spatially-balanced subset of n=5 tower plots are sampled annually, and the full complement of Tower plots is sampled every 5 years. At slow-growth-increment sites (RMNP, YELL, NIWO, WREF, SJER, SOAP, TEAK, BONA, DEJU, HEAL), dendrometer bands are measured annually on a subset of individuals within Tower plots. At desert sites with sensitive vegetation and soils (i.e., MOAB, JORN, SRER, ONAQ), there is no annual Tower plot measurement and the full complement of Tower plots is measured every 5 years only. Ferns are only sampled in Tower plots when all Tower plots are sampled every 5 years; that is, ferns are not measured annually in the n=5 Tower plot subset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| At all sites, Distributed plot sampling and sampling of the full set of Tower plots is scheduled in a staggered manner such that sites generate data either from all Distributed plots or all Tower plots every 2-3 years. Sites that do not have qualifying woody vegetation are surveyed every 5 years to determine whether ingrowth of qualifying woody vegetation has occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| At sites with seasonal senescence, the onset of sampling in a given year is triggered by senescence of canopy or understory individuals. Sampling must be completed before growth begins the following season and within 4 months of sampling onset. At sites with no distinct season, sampling begins within ± 2 weeks of the same date, and must be completed within 60 days of sampling onset. The Teakettle site (TEAK) in California is an exception: Here, site logistics dictate a late June sampling start date.

per site, and tower plot sampling would generate up to 20 or 30 vst_perboutperyear records per site, depending on the total number of tower plots established at the site. In cases where fewer than the maximum number of records were generated per sampling event, the reduced number of records reflects lower levels of sampling effort and additional records should not be expected.

i.e., reported at a higher taxonomic rank than the raw data, to avoid publishing locations of sensitive species. For a few sites with stricter regulations (e.g., Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM)), records for species of concern are not published.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Queries for this data product return data from the user-specified date range for the `vst_perplotperyear`, `vst_apparentindividual`, `vst_non-woody`, and `vst_shrubgroup` tables. For the `vst_mappingandtagging` table, queries ignore the user-specified date range and return all records for each user-selected site regardless of the user-specified date, due to the fact that individuals may be tagged and mapped in a year prior to the user-selected sampling event. Data are provided in monthly download files; queries including any part of a month will return data from the entire month. In the `vst_perplotperyear` table, there should be one record per plotID per eventID, and data in this table describe the presence/absence and sampling area of woody and non-woody growth forms. The `vst_mappingandtagging` table contains at least one record per individualID, and provides data that are invariant through time, including tagID, taxonID, and mapped location (if applicable). Duplicates in `vst_mappingandtagging` may exist at the individualID level if errors have been corrected after ingest of the original record; in this instance, users are advised to use the most recent record for a given individualID. The `vst_apparentindividual` table contains one record per individualID per eventID, and includes growth form, structure and plant status data that may be linked to `vst_mappingandtagging` records via the individualID; records may also be linked to `vst_perplotperyear` via the plotID and eventID fields in order to generate plot-level estimates of biomass and productivity. The `vst_non-woody` table contains one record per individualID per eventID, and contains growth form, structure and status data that may be linked to `vst_perplotperyear` data via the plotID and eventID fields. The `vst_shrubgroup` table contains a minimum of one record per groupID per plotID per eventID; multiple records with the same groupID may exist if a given shrub group comprises more than one taxonID. Data provided in the `vst_shrubgroup` table allow calculation of live and dead volume per taxonID within each shrub group, and records may be linked with the `vst_perplotperyear` table via the plotID and eventID fields. |\n| <!----> |\n| For all tables, duplicates may exist where protocol and/or data entry aberrations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before joining tables. For the `vst_apparentindividual` table, the combination of the `eventID` x `individualID` x `tempStemID` fields should be unique. The `tempStemID` field is used to uniquely identify the stems within a multi-stem individual within a sampling event, but the identity of these stems is not tracked from year-to-year; individuals with a single stem are assigned a `tempStemID` of 1.

From the inception of these two data products, the ‘vst\\_perplotperyear’ table was common to both; moreover, recent evolution of the ‘Non-herbaceous’ data product to include mapping and tagging of large-stature cacti, palms, and tree ferns meant that the ‘vst\\_mappingandtagging’ table was also shared across the two products. Splitting out the ‘vst\\_non-woody’ table into a separate product therefore created unnecessary complexity for data end-users who wished to understand the totality of vegetation structure measurements collected at a site where non-herbaceous perennial vegetation was present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & The ‘Woody plant vegetation structure’ (DP1.10098.001) and ‘Non-herbaceous perennial vegetation structure’ (DP1.10045.001) data products were bundled into the new ‘Vegetation structure’ data product (DP1.10098.001).

The new method selects plots for annual sampling such that plots are proportionally representative of the NLCD vegetation classes present in each site's Tower airshed, and the method maximizes collocation of Vegetation Structure measurements with annual TOS soil and plant diversity sampling. In Domain 05, the plots identified for annual sampling according to the new method are: \n\n`STEI\\_047`, `STEI\\_053`, `STEI\\_056`, `STEI\\_059`, `STEI\\_060`\n`TREE\\_041`, `TREE\\_046`, `TREE\\_049`, `TREE\\_054`, `TREE\\_056`\n`UNDE\\_037`, `UNDE\\_038`, `UNDE\\_043`, `UNDE\\_044`, `UNDE\\_045` \n\nFor the following sites and years, plots were sampled according to the older spatial balance algorithm that does not account for NLCD Vegetation Class, and does not maximize collocation with soil and plant diversity data products: \n\n2020 STEI subset measured: `STEI\\_046`, `STEI\\_047`, `STEI\\_048`, `STEI\\_049`, `STEI\\_050`\n2021 STEI subset measured: `STEI\\_046`, `STEI\\_047`, `STEI\\_053`, `STEI\\_056`, `STEI\\_059`, `STEI\\_060`\n2020 TREE subset measured: `TREE\\_039`, `TREE\\_040`, `TREE\\_041`, `TREE\\_042`, `TREE\\_043`\n2020 UNDE subset measured: `UNDE\\_037`, `UNDE\\_038`, `UNDE\\_043`, `UNDE\\_044`, `UNDE\\_065`\n2021 UNDE subset measured: `UNDE\\_037`, `UNDE\\_038`, `UNDE\\_043`, `UNDE\\_044`, `UNDE\\_045`, `UNDE\\_065` & From 2022 onward, Tower plots selected for annual sampling at STEI, TREE, and UNDE are:\n\n`STEI\\_047`, `STEI\\_053`, `STEI\\_056`, `STEI\\_059`, `STEI\\_060`\n`TREE\\_041`, `TREE\\_046`, `TREE\\_049`, `TREE\\_054`, `TREE\\_056`\n`UNDE\\_037`, `UNDE\\_038`, `UNDE\\_043`, `UNDE\\_044`, `UNDE\\_045`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n\t 68808 & NA & 2022-09-15T00:00:00Z & 2022-10-31T00:00:00Z & 2022-06-12T00:00:00Z & 2022-10-31T00:00:00Z & YELL                                                                                                                                                                   & Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff.

However, since 2020 ferns are only scheduled for sampling every 5 years in Tower plots, and thus ferns are no longer measured in four out of five years in annually sampled Tower plots. For annually sampled Tower plots where ferns are the only 'other' type of growth form, the reported totalSampledAreaOther value suggested no fern biomass for four out of five years, when in fact ferns simply were not sampled for those years. Moreover, in annually sampled Tower plots where ferns coexist with some of the ‘other’ growth forms (e.g., palms in D03, xerophyllum in D16, tree ferns in D20), we reported a totalSampledAreaOther value for the ‘other’ growth forms that were measured annually, and for four out of five years we created the impression that zero fern biomass was legitimately measured, even though ferns were not scheduled for sampling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & Introduced new ‘nestedSubplotAreaFerns’ and ‘totalSampledAreaFerns’ fields in the vst\\_perplotperyear table to account for fern measurement separately from remaining ‘other’ growth forms. The ‘totalSampledAreaFerns’ field is now NULL when ferns are present but not sampled due to the scheduled bout type. In addition, the totalSampledAreaOther field now accurately reflects the sampling effort for the remaining ‘other’ growth forms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n\t 77905 & NA & 2023-03-01T00:00:00Z & 2023-03-01T00:00:00Z & 2015-01-01T00:00:00Z & 2023-03-01T00:00:00Z & DSNY, JERC, OSBS                                                                                                                                                       & A single ‘palm’ growth form was applied to all palm trees, regardless of size, and to shrub-type palms.

The format consists of the identity of the plot point in the southwest corner of the subplot, the scale or size of the subplot, and, for those subplots smaller than 100 m2, the corner of the 100 m2 subplot in which the smaller subplot is located. For example, ‘21\\_400’ refers to a subplot with point 21 in the southwest corner and having 400 m2 area (20 m x 20 m).

For the affected date range, field staff working at the D13 MOAB site were provided guidance to assess cover from and measure small, multi-stem shrub individuals only if ≥ 50\\% of stems for a given individual had basal diameter ≥ 1 cm. This guidance was inconsistent with the Vegetation Structure protocol (NEON.DOC.000987), which instructs to measure small, multi-stem shrub individuals if at least one stem has basal diameter ≥ 1 cm. Because guidance not consistent with the protocol was followed, plots sampled at MOAB in the affected date range included approximately 10 fewer small, multi-stem shrubs per plot than if the Vegetation Structure protocol guidance were followed. Measuring fewer individuals per plot means that per plot biomass and volume estimates for the ‘small shrub’ growth form are lower for 2023 than for other years.

‘towerSubset’. When Tower plots are sampled for Vegetation Structure, a ‘towerSubset’ of n=5 plots are sampled annually, and the full complement of plots are sampled every 5 years. Prior to 2020, the five annually sampled towerSubset plots were determined using only spatial balance criteria, and at some sites, this resulted in over- or under-representation of NLCD vegetation classes relative to the full complement of Tower plots. From 2020 onward, spatial balance and NLCD representation criteria were used to select the annually sampled towerSubset plots, and a Plot Prioritization list was distributed to communicate the change. However, implementation of the change was not immediate at some sites, and the actual annual towerSubset sampled at affected sites differed from the Plot Prioritization list for at least one sampling year in the affected date range. The deviation from the Plot Prioritization list means that biomass and productivity estimates derived from the towerSubset plots at affected sites may not be as representative as possible of the full complement of Tower plots. For the PUUM site the issue was slightly different; at PUUM, deviations in spatial balance occurred to better coordinate Vegetation Structure sampling in the annual Tower subset with soil sampling, and these deviations were not documented in the approved Plot Prioritization list.                                                                          & For the site-specific resolution dates identified below, annual sampling for Vegetation Structure in the towerSubset occurs in plots identified by spatial balance and NLCD vegetation type criteria, and annually sampled plots are consistent with the Plot Prioritization list. At the D20 PUUM site, all plots have the same NLCD type (i.e., evergreen forest), and a slight deviation from the spatially-balanced Plot Prioritization list was approved for Vegetation Structure sampling to enable spatial coordination with soil sampling (DP1.10086.001), which is constrained by soil depth in some plots due to relatively recent lava flow. \n\nSite-specific resolution dates: \nD05 STEI and UNDE – deviations in 2020 and 2021, resolved thereafter. \nD05 TREE – deviations in 2020, resolved thereafter. \nD06 KONZ – deviations in 2020 and more plots sampled than expected in 2021; resolved thereafter. \nD07 GRSM and ORNL – deviations in 2020, resolved thereafter. \nD07 MLBS – deviations in 2020 and 2021, resolved thereafter. \nD08 DELA and LENO – deviations from 2020-2022, resolved thereafter. \nD11 CLBJ – deviations in 2020, resolved thereafter. \nD19 BONA and DEJU – deviations in 2020, resolved thereafter. \nD20 PUUM – inconsistent annual Tower subset sampled from 2020-2023; resolved thereafter.           \\\\\n\t 92604 & NA & 2024-09-05T00:00:00Z & 2024-08-27T00:00:00Z & 2014-01-01T00:00:00Z & 2024-08-14T00:00:00Z & JERC, OSBS, GUAN, CPER, CLBJ, JORN, SRER                                                                                                                               & Yucca sampling: The protocol lacked a height threshold for sampling the yucca growth form, resulting in sampling many small-stature yucca that likely contribute relatively little to plot-level biomass. The protocol also lacked guidance for measuring ‘height’ for yucca with flower stalks.

That is, for a jagged break, the reported data could correspond to vertical distance between the lowest and highest parts of the break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & From 2024 onward, reported break height data conform to protocol expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\\\\n\t 99904 & NA & 2025-02-17T00:00:00Z & 2025-02-17T00:00:00Z & 2015-07-01T00:00:00Z & 2024-11-21T00:00:00Z & RMNP, NIWO, ABBY, WREF                                                                                                                                                 & Crown diameter error: For leaning individuals, the main bole(s) may extend beyond the average extent of the crown.

non-herbaceous perennial plants from all terrestrial NEON sites with qualifying woody vegetation. The exact measurements collected per individual depend on growth form, and these measurements are focused on enabling biomass and productivity estimation, estimation of shrub volume and biomass, and calibration / validation of multiple NEON airborne remote-sensing data products. In general, comparatively large individuals that are visible to remote-sensing instruments are mapped, tagged, and measured, and other smaller and understory individuals are tagged and measured but not mapped. Structure and mapping data are reported per individual per plot. Smaller individuals may be subsampled using nested subplots in order to standardize the per plot sampling effort; total sampled area data reported in the vst\\_perplotperyear table are required to convert measurements made using nested subplots to the plot scale.

Description: Vegetation Structure data are collected from Distributed and Tower plots. Each Distributed plot is sampled in a given bout if at least one tree with Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm or one tree palm is present. If trees with DBH ≥ 10 cm and tree palms are absent, all smaller qualifying vegetation is considered: both woody and non-herbaceous perennial vegetation are sampled if all qualifying individuals of both types comprise ≥ 10\\% aerial cover of the plot. For example, a Distributed plot with 10\\% aerial cover comprising a mix of small shrubs and yucca would be sampled for yucca even if total yucca cover is < 10\\% aerial cover. Ferns, Xerophyllum, and Yucca have additional sampling criteria within Distributed plots: These three growth forms are not measured when the NLCD vegetation type of the plot is Deciduous Forest, Evergreen Forest, or Mixed Forest. In addition, when Distributed plot NLCD vegetation type is not forest, ferns are only sampled when aerial cover is ≥ 50\\% within the plot. Tower plots are sampled if at least one tree with DBH ≥ 10 cm or one tree palm is present in ≥ 10\\% of Tower plots, or if smaller qualifying individuals comprise ≥ 10\\% of aerial cover averaged across all Tower plots. Within both Distributed and Tower plots, all individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm are mapped and measured throughout the plot sampling area. Individuals with DBH < 10 cm are mapped if a) individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm are absent from the plot, and b) they are visible to airborne remote-sensing instruments. If stem density thresholds are met, individuals with DBH < 10 cm and non-herbaceous perennial vegetation, such as ferns and saw palmetto, may be measured within nested subplots in order to standardize the sampling effort across plots.\\\\\n\t At all sites at which qualifying woody vegetation is present, Distributed plots are sampled every 5 years. At most sites with qualifying woody vegetation, a spatially-balanced subset of n=5 tower plots are sampled annually, and the full complement of Tower plots is sampled every 5 years. At slow-growth-increment sites (RMNP, YELL, NIWO, WREF, SJER, SOAP, TEAK, BONA, DEJU, HEAL), dendrometer bands are measured annually on a subset of individuals within Tower plots. At desert sites with sensitive vegetation and soils (i.e., MOAB, JORN, SRER, ONAQ), there is no annual Tower plot measurement and the full complement of Tower plots is measured every 5 years only. Ferns are only sampled in Tower plots when all Tower plots are sampled every 5 years; that is, ferns are not measured annually in the n=5 Tower plot subset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n\t At all sites, Distributed plot sampling and sampling of the full set of Tower plots is scheduled in a staggered manner such that sites generate data either from all Distributed plots or all Tower plots every 2-3 years. Sites that do not have qualifying woody vegetation are surveyed every 5 years to determine whether ingrowth of qualifying woody vegetation has occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n\t At sites with seasonal senescence, the onset of sampling in a given year is triggered by senescence of canopy or understory individuals. Sampling must be completed before growth begins the following season and within 4 months of sampling onset. At sites with no distinct season, sampling begins within ± 2 weeks of the same date, and must be completed within 60 days of sampling onset. The Teakettle site (TEAK) in California is an exception: Here, site logistics dictate a late June sampling start date.

sampling would generate up to 20 vst\\_perboutperyear records per site, and tower plot sampling would generate up to 20 or 30 vst\\_perboutperyear records per site, depending on the total number of tower plots established at the site. In cases where fewer than the maximum number of records were generated per sampling event, the reduced number of records reflects lower levels of sampling effort and additional records should not be expected.

'fuzzed', i.e., reported at a higher taxonomic rank than the raw data, to avoid publishing locations of sensitive species. For a few sites with stricter regulations (e.g., Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM)), records for species of concern are not published.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n\t Queries for this data product return data from the user-specified date range for the `vst\\_perplotperyear`, `vst\\_apparentindividual`, `vst\\_non-woody`, and `vst\\_shrubgroup` tables. For the `vst\\_mappingandtagging` table, queries ignore the user-specified date range and return all records for each user-selected site regardless of the user-specified date, due to the fact that individuals may be tagged and mapped in a year prior to the user-selected sampling event. Data are provided in monthly download files; queries including any part of a month will return data from the entire month. In the `vst\\_perplotperyear` table, there should be one record per plotID per eventID, and data in this table describe the presence/absence and sampling area of woody and non-woody growth forms. The `vst\\_mappingandtagging` table contains at least one record per individualID, and provides data that are invariant through time, including tagID, taxonID, and mapped location (if applicable). Duplicates in `vst\\_mappingandtagging` may exist at the individualID level if errors have been corrected after ingest of the original record; in this instance, users are advised to use the most recent record for a given individualID. The `vst\\_apparentindividual` table contains one record per individualID per eventID, and includes growth form, structure and plant status data that may be linked to `vst\\_mappingandtagging` records via the individualID; records may also be linked to `vst\\_perplotperyear` via the plotID and eventID fields in order to generate plot-level estimates of biomass and productivity. The `vst\\_non-woody` table contains one record per individualID per eventID, and contains growth form, structure and status data that may be linked to `vst\\_perplotperyear` data via the plotID and eventID fields. The `vst\\_shrubgroup` table contains a minimum of one record per groupID per plotID per eventID; multiple records with the same groupID may exist if a given shrub group comprises more than one taxonID. Data provided in the `vst\\_shrubgroup` table allow calculation of live and dead volume per taxonID within each shrub group, and records may be linked with the `vst\\_perplotperyear` table via the plotID and eventID fields.\\\\\n\t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n\t For all tables, duplicates may exist where protocol and/or data entry aberrations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before joining tables. For the `vst\\_apparentindividual` table, the combination of the `eventID` x `individualID` x `tempStemID` fields should be unique. The `tempStemID` field is used to uniquely identify the stems within a multi-stem individual within a sampling event, but the identity of these stems is not tracked from year-to-year; individuals with a single stem are assigned a `tempStemID` of 1.

and/or processing algorithms will occur on an as-needed basis, and query reproducibility cannot be guaranteed. Once data are published as part of a Data Release, they are no longer provisional, and are associated with a stable DOI.

In addition, the autumn wildfire season is lengthening, and effects on air quality have resulted in increased sampling cancellation during the months of August, September, and October when vegetation should ideally be sampled. After October, snowfall typically prevents site access and it has therefore not been possible to complete scheduled Vegetation Structure sampling at TEAK.\n",

From the inception of these two data products, the ‘vst_perplotperyear’ table was common to both; moreover, recent evolution of the ‘Non-herbaceous’ data product to include mapping and tagging of large-stature cacti, palms, and tree ferns meant that the ‘vst_mappingandtagging’ table was also shared across the two products. Splitting out the ‘vst_non-woody’ table into a separate product therefore created unnecessary complexity for data end-users who wished to understand the totality of vegetation structure measurements collected at a site where non-herbaceous perennial vegetation was present.\n",

However, since 2020 ferns are only scheduled for sampling every 5 years in Tower plots, and thus ferns are no longer measured in four out of five years in annually sampled Tower plots. For annually sampled Tower plots where ferns are the only 'other' type of growth form, the reported totalSampledAreaOther value suggested no fern biomass for four out of five years, when in fact ferns simply were not sampled for those years. Moreover, in annually sampled Tower plots where ferns coexist with some of the ‘other’ growth forms (e.g., palms in D03, xerophyllum in D16, tree ferns in D20), we reported a totalSampledAreaOther value for the ‘other’ growth forms that were measured annually, and for four out of five years we created the impression that zero fern biomass was legitimately measured, even though ferns were not scheduled for sampling.\n",

For the affected date range, field staff working at the D13 MOAB site were provided guidance to assess cover from and measure small, multi-stem shrub individuals only if ≥ 50% of stems for a given individual had basal diameter ≥ 1 cm. This guidance was inconsistent with the Vegetation Structure protocol (NEON.DOC.000987), which instructs to measure small, multi-stem shrub individuals if at least one stem has basal diameter ≥ 1 cm. Because guidance not consistent with the protocol was followed, plots sampled at MOAB in the affected date range included approximately 10 fewer small, multi-stem shrubs per plot than if the Vegetation Structure protocol guidance were followed. Measuring fewer individuals per plot means that per plot biomass and volume estimates for the ‘small shrub’ growth form are lower for 2023 than for other years.\n",

When Tower plots are sampled for Vegetation Structure, a ‘towerSubset’ of n=5 plots are sampled annually, and the full complement of plots are sampled every 5 years. Prior to 2020, the five annually sampled towerSubset plots were determined using only spatial balance criteria, and at some sites, this resulted in over- or under-representation of NLCD vegetation classes relative to the full complement of Tower plots. From 2020 onward, spatial balance and NLCD representation criteria were used to select the annually sampled towerSubset plots, and a Plot Prioritization list was distributed to communicate the change. However, implementation of the change was not immediate at some sites, and the actual annual towerSubset sampled at affected sites differed from the Plot Prioritization list for at least one sampling year in the affected date range. The deviation from the Plot Prioritization list means that biomass and productivity estimates derived from the towerSubset plots at affected sites may not be as representative as possible of the full complement of Tower plots. For the PUUM site the issue was slightly different; at PUUM, deviations in spatial balance occurred to better coordinate Vegetation Structure sampling in the annual Tower subset with soil sampling, and these deviations were not documented in the approved Plot Prioritization list.\n",

The protocol also lacked guidance for measuring ‘height’ for yucca with flower stalks. As such, all past 'height' measurements for yucca are unclear with respect to whether the individual was flowering and whether the flower stalk may have been included in the height.\n",

At the D03 OSBS site, the plots OSBS_017 and OSBS_021 were sampled in 2015 and data was recorded in the vst_apparentindividual table, but no associated records in the vst_mappingandtagging table were created.

The intent is to report the vertical distance between the ground and the average height of the break above the ground. Instead, technicians may have reported break height data corresponding to the height of the break itself. That is, for a jagged break, the reported data could correspond to vertical distance between the lowest and highest parts of the break.\n",

              "26: The subplot naming convention is updated across all data products with observations and samples that originate from Base plots. The format consists of the identity of the plot point in the southwest corner of the subplot, the scale or size of the subplot, and, for those subplots smaller than 100 m2, the corner of the 100 m2 subplot in which the smaller subplot is located. For example, ‘21_400’ refers to a subplot with point 21 in the southwest corner and having 400 m2 area (20 m x 20 m). Similarly, ‘31_1_1’ refers to a subplot with point 31 in the southwest corner, having 1 m2 area, and located in corner 1 of the 100 m2 subplot with point 31 in the southwest corner.

The exact measurements collected per individual depend on growth form, and these measurements are focused on enabling biomass and productivity estimation, estimation of shrub volume and biomass, and calibration / validation of multiple NEON airborne remote-sensing data products. In general, comparatively large individuals that are visible to remote-sensing instruments are mapped, tagged, and measured, and other smaller and understory individuals are tagged and measured but not mapped. Structure and mapping data are reported per individual per plot. Smaller individuals may be subsampled using nested subplots in order to standardize the per plot sampling effort; total sampled area data reported in the vst_perplotperyear table are required to convert measurements made using nested subplots to the plot scale.

Each Distributed plot is sampled in a given bout if at least one tree with Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm or one tree palm is present. If trees with DBH ≥ 10 cm and tree palms are absent, all smaller qualifying vegetation is considered: both woody and non-herbaceous perennial vegetation are sampled if all qualifying individuals of both types comprise ≥ 10% aerial cover of the plot. For example, a Distributed plot with 10% aerial cover comprising a mix of small shrubs and yucca would be sampled for yucca even if total yucca cover is < 10% aerial cover. Ferns, Xerophyllum, and Yucca have additional sampling criteria within Distributed plots: These three growth forms are not measured when the NLCD vegetation type of the plot is Deciduous Forest, Evergreen Forest, or Mixed Forest. In addition, when Distributed plot NLCD vegetation type is not forest, ferns are only sampled when aerial cover is ≥ 50% within the plot. Tower plots are sampled if at least one tree with DBH ≥ 10 cm or one tree palm is present in ≥ 10% of Tower plots, or if smaller qualifying individuals comprise ≥ 10% of aerial cover averaged across all Tower plots. Within both Distributed and Tower plots, all individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm are mapped and measured throughout the plot sampling area. Individuals with DBH < 10 cm are mapped if a) individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm are absent from the plot, and b) they are visible to airborne remote-sensing instruments. If stem density thresholds are met, individuals with DBH < 10 cm and non-herbaceous perennial vegetation, such as ferns and saw palmetto, may be measured within nested subplots in order to standardize the sampling effort across plots.\n",

At most sites with qualifying woody vegetation, a spatially-balanced subset of n=5 tower plots are sampled annually, and the full complement of Tower plots is sampled every 5 years. At slow-growth-increment sites (RMNP, YELL, NIWO, WREF, SJER, SOAP, TEAK, BONA, DEJU, HEAL), dendrometer bands are measured annually on a subset of individuals within Tower plots. At desert sites with sensitive vegetation and soils (i.e., MOAB, JORN, SRER, ONAQ), there is no annual Tower plot measurement and the full complement of Tower plots is measured every 5 years only. Ferns are only sampled in Tower plots when all Tower plots are sampled every 5 years; that is, ferns are not measured annually in the n=5 Tower plot subset.\n",

Sites that do not have qualifying woody vegetation are surveyed every 5 years to determine whether ingrowth of qualifying woody vegetation has occurred.\n",

Sampling must be completed before growth begins the following season and within 4 months of sampling onset. At sites with no distinct season, sampling begins within ± 2 weeks of the same date, and must be completed within 60 days of sampling onset. The Teakettle site (TEAK) in California is an exception: Here, site logistics dictate a late June sampling start date. See NEON.DOC.000987 for more details.\n",

In 2020, a new method was employed to identify a spatially balanced subset of n=5 Tower plots for annual sampling. The new method selects plots for annual sampling such that plots are proportionally representative of the NLCD vegetation classes present in each site's Tower airshed, and the method maximizes collocation of Vegetation Structure measurements with annual TOS soil and plant diversity sampling. In Domain 05, the plots identified for annual sampling according to the new method are: \n",

In addition, the autumn wildfire season is lengthening, and effects on air quality have resulted in increased sampling cancellation during the months of August, September, and October when vegetation should ideally be sampled. After October, snowfall typically prevents site access and it has therefore not been possible to complete scheduled Vegetation Structure sampling at TEAK.\n",

From the inception of these two data products, the ‘vst_perplotperyear’ table was common to both; moreover, recent evolution of the ‘Non-herbaceous’ data product to include mapping and tagging of large-stature cacti, palms, and tree ferns meant that the ‘vst_mappingandtagging’ table was also shared across the two products. Splitting out the ‘vst_non-woody’ table into a separate product therefore created unnecessary complexity for data end-users who wished to understand the totality of vegetation structure measurements collected at a site where non-herbaceous perennial vegetation was present.\n",

The format of these ‘temporary’ individualIDs is ‘TEMP.PLA.SITE.yearBoutBegan.NN###, where NN = the numeric portion of the plotID, and ### = an auto-incremented numerical `tempID` that resets within each plotID. IndividualID values of this format are temporary in that they do not correspond to the same individual from year-to-year.\n",

In cases where fewer than the maximum number of records were generated per sampling event, the reduced number of records reflects lower levels of sampling effort and additional records should not be expected.\n",

For a few sites with stricter regulations (e.g., Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM)), records for species of concern are not published. \n",
              "170 Queries for this data product return data from the user-specified date range for the `vst_perplotperyear`, `vst_apparentindividual`, `vst_non-woody`, and `vst_shrubgroup` tables. For the `vst_mappingandtagging` table, queries ignore the user-specified date range and return all records for each user-selected site regardless of the user-specified date, due to the fact that individuals may be tagged and mapped in a year prior to the user-selected sampling event. Data are provided in monthly download files; queries including any part of a month will return data from the entire month. In the `vst_perplotperyear` table, there should be one record per plotID per eventID, and data in this table describe the presence/absence and sampling area of woody and non-woody growth forms. The `vst_mappingandtagging` table contains at least one record per individualID, and provides data that are invariant through time, including tagID, taxonID, and mapped location (if applicable). Duplicates in `vst_mappingandtagging` may exist at the individualID level if errors have been corrected after ingest of the original record; in this instance, users are advised to use the most recent record for a given individualID. The `vst_apparentindividual` table contains one record per individualID per eventID, and includes growth form, structure and plant status data that may be linked to `vst_mappingandtagging` records via the individualID; records may also be linked to `vst_perplotperyear` via the plotID and eventID fields in order to generate plot-level estimates of biomass and productivity. The `vst_non-woody` table contains one record per individualID per eventID, and contains growth form, structure and status data that may be linked to `vst_perplotperyear` data via the plotID and eventID fields. The `vst_shrubgroup` table contains a minimum of one record per groupID per plotID per eventID; multiple records with the same groupID may exist if a given shrub group comprises more than one taxonID. Data provided in the `vst_shrubgroup` table allow calculation of live and dead volume per taxonID within each shrub group, and records may be linked with the `vst_perplotperyear` table via the plotID and eventID fields.\n",

For the `vst_apparentindividual` table, the combination of the `eventID` x `individualID` x `tempStemID` fields should be unique. The `tempStemID` field is used to uniquely identify the stems within a multi-stem individual within a sampling event, but the identity of these stems is not tracked from year-to-year; individuals with a single stem are assigned a `tempStemID` of 1.
